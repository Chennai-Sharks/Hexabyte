Application for using food waste as consumable organic resource.
Work in progress.

## Problem statement
	
In Southeast Asia, food waste is discharged daily from factories, restaurants, supermarkets, etc. This waste has potential to be reused as an organic resource providing it can be transformed with the correct technology. Collection of the food waste from such areas and categorizing them to what they can be used into is a major task for this problem statement.It is found that there is discharge of food waste daily from various types of places i.e. restaurants, factories, supermarkets etc. Most of this food waste are either dumped or destroyed by some means. We want this food waste to be reused in such a manner that it can be helpful for the society. Food waste reusability can highly boost the economical sector of the country.We are looking for ideas to reuse food waste as a consumable organic resource or ideas in Digital management or Effective Use of Waste Material for the Food and Beverage Industry(e.g. Factory, Restaurant, Supermarket, Warehouse, Building and so on) and its supply chain. Some issues which could be tackled under this category include, but are not restricted to, the following: Biogas power generation, Compost, Transforming food waste into animal feed.
